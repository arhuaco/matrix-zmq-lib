Small Wrapper for the ZeroMQ library

The idea of this small wrapper is to serve as a documentation of the
usage of a subset of ZeroMQ features, the ones that we are using.

In the .hpp files you'll find remarks about the behavior of the different
socket types.

One of the remarkable features of the sockets is that the same socket types
can either bind or connect.

You can check the Unit tests for usage examples.

The file third_party/zmq.hpp has a license different than the one of the project.
